# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Judith!

I'm a **Technical Computer Science student** with a focus on **embedded systems** and **low-level programming**.  
I have basic experience in **C, C++, Ruby, VHDL**, and **Assembly (ARM & x86)**.

## About the Projects
The projects in this repository were originally developed as part of my university coursework and versioned using the universityâ€™s internal Git system.
They were later re-uploaded here to make them publicly accessible and therefore do not include the original commit history.
These repositories mainly contain the parts I developed.
